 * case. Everything that would otherwise advertise the spec — the route, the
 * `service-desc` link in the document head, the Optional section of llms.txt —
 * asks here first, so a site with no endpoints never points a reader or an
 * agent at a document with no paths in it.
 *
 * That matters more for agents than for people. A person who opens an empty
 * spec closes it; an agent that fetches one may take it as evidence that the
 * API has no endpoints and answer accordingly.
