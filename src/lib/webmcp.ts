/**
 * The relay between a WebMCP browser agent and this site's own MCP endpoint.
 *
 * This lives in a module rather than inline in `WebMcpBridge.astro` for one
 * reason: a test can import it. The bridge only runs inside a browser that ships
 * the WebMCP API, which no test here has, so the inline version was unverifiable
 * by construction — and it was in fact broken from the day the MCP endpoint
 * moved to the official SDK, silently, because nothing exercised it. What is
 * left in the component is the part that genuinely needs a browser: reading
 * `modelContext` and registering tools.
 *
 * Both defects came from assuming the transport was plain JSON-RPC over POST:
 *
 *   1. The specification requires a client to accept *both* `application/json`
 *      and `text/event-stream`, and the SDK enforces it with a 406. The bridge
 *      sent no `Accept` header at all, so every tool call was refused.
 *   2. Given that header, the SDK answers in SSE. `response.json()` throws on
 *      it. Fixing only the first defect would have moved the failure, not
 *      removed it.
