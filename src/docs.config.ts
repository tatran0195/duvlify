 *                  properties at runtime, so changing the accent is one line here.
 *                  The neutral palette and component styling live in src/styles.
 *   - `navigation` the sidebar structure. Pages are referenced by id (their path
 *                  under content/, without the extension) and the URL is that id.
 *                  Labels, descriptions, icons and badges come from each page's
 *                  own frontmatter — never restated here.
 *
 * src/lib/navigation.ts validates this against the content collection at build

 *
 * It is written out here rather than only in the guide because this is the file
 * someone opens looking for a language setting, and because a specification
 * kept next to the code it would change is one that stays true. The routing
 * half already works — a page's URL is its path under content/, so
 * content/fr/guides/authoring.mdx is served at /fr/guides/authoring with no new
 * code. What has to be built is the sidebar, the canonical and hreflang set,
 * the freshness check, and the machine outputs.

 * modes, the seventeen surfaces and the file each one lives in, and the
 * assertions an implementation has to satisfy. Read it before writing any of
 * this, and uncommenting this block is the first step.
 *
 * The step before that one is the `generateId` override in content.config.ts.
